//time spent: definitely over 20h, I have lost count, I have not slept for the last
//3 days (tuesday to friday) for longer than 5 hours. (I am not even counting the tutorials)
//It is so bad, I did not even shower and eat only 2 meals a day since I started coding this assignment.
//I have been to almost every office hours there is just to get stuck immediately after fixing the last issue...
//I am very much hating the fact that every single fucking tutorial uses the most
//useless syntax that would immediately get me smited with at least -15 points
//because the rubric specified that we are NOT putting everything into public
//and we are NOT putting everything into main
//fuck this shit. I am very pationate about hating these errors.

//Now give me your best grade! This is a robbery!

//Bump the hours up to 25+, I apparently don't know how to assign & to do by refference correctly.

//Credit to Lance Schneider and Aleksey Dochez, couple of my senior CS major friends and all the office hours helpers for getting me unstuck every couple minutes.
