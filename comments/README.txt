Name: Ota Lichnovsky
Time spent: About 20 - 23 hours (25 if you count the suffocating hours)

  I started on Tuesday, I mostly just look over the assignment and then thought about the structure for a couple of hours, not too many though, about 2. I had an exam coming so I had to do some test prep (I got 39/50, not bad by me, but I was the last one to finish). I did some basic implementation, but I pretty much changed everything between v4 (latest version that day) and the current version, mainly because of some edge cases explanations, just a tiiiny little detailed that RUINED EVERYTHING FOR ME. You know, like making it so deleting a comment, actually doesn't delete it from the output, or maybe that one tiny little thing I still have no idea how it works, called number of replies (who designed this shit???). 

  Anyway, here is my quick time review:
Tuesday: 2 hours
Thursday: 4 hours (day before the exam lol)
Friday: 7 hours (I locked in)
Today (Saturday): I expect to hit 10 hours (I have 7 at the time of writing) unless I actually get 33/33 on the test cases. I have 26/33 as of time of writing.

  You may also look at this time sheet and be like: "Ota, you balding muffin, why did you not work on Wednesday, you only have one lab that day?" To that I say: I started having pain on Tuesday in my arm. Same spot as before, also came out of nowhere when I was sitting at the desk, so I though I could ignore it and move on. Then out of nowhere, I wake up after like 14 hours of sleep to my alarm clock at 3:36 pm (I have it set to 3pm and every 9 minutes repeat, do the math) and my left lung was on fire. I rush to the labs, ignoring the pain and actually finish quick for once. I try to call the health office, but they were already closed. So I tried to do anything but ended up on the call with my friends just mumbling for a couple hours (they threatened me with calling a campus police raid in the morning if I did not get checked out next morning) and then tried to sleep. Emphasis on the work "tried" because I could not breathe fully without sever pain. So I randomly did the exorcist "GET OUT OF MY BODY DEMON" stretch, something popped and then it was much better. What was the issue? Well, maybe sitting like a goblin all day at the desk and not going to the gym and holding all the stress in probably is not the best for your body. I did actually tried to spend about 2 hours, but did not progress at all on Wednesday, so that is why I did not feel like including it. 

  Moving on, if I had tried to describe every single structure, but the idea was that we make the least amount of edits to the tree, so I do not mess up the structure (foreshadowing). If you are asking why am I storing everything in class nodes and why do I not have .h and .cpp files for those, weeel it is a semester long silent war I have with classes. I just hate them because you have to create separate files for them and naming those as a version as a whole can be pain in the butt. I label everything as v1, v2, etc. so, you know.

  About the foreshadowing, I HAD at some point a map that mapped the whole tree and not just one tree of comments, where I had a general mother set as first and then the children were the actual comments that were called for output (so if mom is level 0, level 1 is the output). But at some moment when I put the code to the AI to fix my warcrime level syntax, the bot was like "DON'T MINF IF I DO" aaand I have lost track when. Thank you bots, you are sooo helping me. So now I have to fix that and the number of replies that does not even match the total comments or total of just level 2s (aka. direct responses to that level 1 comment) in some cases. YES, I DID COUNT THEM BY HAND, HOW DID YOU KNOW AM NOT A SANE PERSON. 
  I think it is slightly too late to ask that though. I have posted one question on the submitty before asking how does the delete actually work and got 1 response. You can probably track it down.
  The one thing I have to fess up for is that I bought ChatGTP premium today and holy shit it is such a difference. Now I understand how some of my friends always have half my time spent. 

  I will try to edit the README if I come up with something on time, I have 3 hours left. Stay tuned. 

I could not retrieve the old method that allowed the previously described two and more trees (that was the breaking point for me to get the premium), but I almost forgot to comment everything out, so that will be my last update. I will rather spend more time on the test prep than to do this anymore. The score is not perfect, it is just good. Still not ideal for me.
