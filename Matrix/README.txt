UPDATED TOTAL HOURS: 4 unproductive (includes cleaning my laptop screen) + 12 productive


// outdated time spent: I have tried to start on Monday this time, but I was so sick I was 
sneezing so hard that I was cleaning my green monitor more than I was typing on the keyboard. 
I have been to the health office where I have been told I have some sort of nasty virosis
and they pretty much told me to stay in my room (unless I am gona be a menace to society 
and start a new pandemic). I have missed my math exam because of this. As of today, I am
finally feeling good enough where I can actually think for more than 5 minutes straight
without sneezing and suffocating (also left half my face was super bloated - I have pics). 
In total I suspect with the "hours" mon - wed, about 10-12. Only on Thursday, I have spent
6 hours of very productive work. To achieve this so fast, I admit to using a lot of AI to 
help me, because the constructor was pretty much the same damn thing I couldn't do in
the first exam. You can see my comments. I came up with most of the structure (loops and if
statements, etc.) myself but I used AI mostly for syntax. I had to rewrite major parts of
the constructor because I just do not really know how to do it properly.
As for the office hours, I have went today on the online Webex session (everyone is getting
sick, don't look at me though) where I tried to fix my DrMemory. It just keeps crashing by 
itself and sometimes my ubunto or whole laptop as well. I was told to find a different 
programm to use, we did not resolve the issue...
That is why i concluded I had to finally start using AI and now I finally understand why
everyone was getting stuff done in half or even third the ammount of time I had. 
It is an amazing but dangerous tool, I just hope it won't replace me when I paid for this
degree.

Also I have to use submitty as my test case, my console is genuinely fucked up.

UPDATE: I have not managed to complete it yesterday, deja vu, here we go again, this time I actually finally understand what the issue was with the last quarter results: I used the wrong operator (% instead of /) so in some cases it just missed a line or two. I am not getting any errors when it comes to memory leaks (got my ubuntu working again, just updating the VScode and restarting the laptop solved it for now, but Dr.Memory is still broken, I will install Valgrind later).

Big thanks to my friend "Sae" who has been marked on Discord as potential terrorist after I shared my code and he pointed it out: 
"This user is suspected to be a part of an online terrorist organization. Report any suspicious activity to Sae's discord staff."
