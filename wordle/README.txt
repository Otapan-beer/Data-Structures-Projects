Total Time Spent: About 35 hours, I have spent about 20 hours coding during the break (which is when I check in with my professor on Monday during his office hours) and then on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday I have spent about 4-6 hours each day. I do not like to keep exact time track because then I just keep staring at the timer.
Cooperation: a bit of AI and a lot of explaining from the mentors at Labs 12 (thank you all, Tashi, Grace & Chris)

I have started on Tuesday 4th (I think, it was pretty much the day the assignment was released, I was already reading it and doing research on o-notation of all containers). I have decided to settle on the std::set<std::vector<std::string>> containers, as you can iterate through all of those. I originally have settled on std::unordered_set<...>, as the set is putting this in order and so it is Olog(N) notation because it uses self balancing binary search tree (found that on google), while unordered_set is not sorting things, but still maintains the convinient part - gets rid of duplicates. Originally I was putting unordered_set everywhere, but I did not know how it fully worked as we did not go though this in DS yet... and I did not know you have to implement something called a "hash" that is basically dictates how are we putting the values into a list. I have been explained this by the mentors during the lab 12 on Wednesday where we used numbers to simplify and as a rule we split the numbers into the list by %4 and we went through the pros and cons where I have realized that the structure essentially looks way differently than I though if I just used the unordered set, but since I was about 200 lines in, I have just changed it to set. 

That is not all though, as I have done a bit a by bit during the break and by Friday 7th, I have spent about 10 hours on research and generally thinking through the structure. I would allocate more time, but I have been to Friend's house in Boston and we had full programm and bucket list of to-do things. 
- A lot of yap regarding sleep, but feel free to read it as it is slightly relevant: (One thing the break made me realize that me performing so badly may be because sleeping 6 hours a day just causes the brain to ignore the pain, it does not mean that all the pain and slowness are actually gone, I am really not a 6 hours of sleep person and I will try to better myself as it honestly sucks when I tried to do 6h of sleep from friday to monday and by monday it just felt absolutely horrible.)

On friday I have realized that I did not fully do the logic of the recursive function and started putting crazy nights of work (went to sleep at 5am once lol) to try and fix the logic in the recursive function, but let's be honest, I had no idea what was I doing since I was half asleep, but really desperate (I am kinda failing right now and I really need this HW bonus). I went to the professor on monday where I have realized I have made a couple mistakes:
1) I am putting words in letter by letter, but if we find out that the for example last letter is not the same as the letter already in, it would just replace everything in the grid where the word was with dots, even when there were already letters instead of dots before.
2) I was replacing the dots after putting the words in with just one random letter (I think t and if that was problematic then q) instead of going through all the possible solutions of letters we could put in there. 
3) I was actually putting the words in only in a way where x would be 0 or +1, not -1 as I did not know how to implement it correctly at the time and then kind of forgot about it (it was 3am, give me a break). 

I have since fixed the issues with minor help from AI. The help was mostly not with the logic (with the exception of making the a-z search process more efficient because mine always timed out, turns out that I was iterating the whole function over for each letter, but I am not really sure how), but rather with the syntax. 

I have fixed the first issue in a way where I implemented a string of original characters into the removeWord function and changed it so it places the characters back instead of replacing them with dots.

In the second problem I have incorrectly implemented the function not only by just putting in these two letters and hoping it will solve itself out, but also later I messed up the recursion somewhere which potentially led to infinite loop (or I ran the whole function 26^n times depending on n amount dots and either way it just timed out. Maybe it was because I just did not fix the first problem before the second one and then I was like "wha???" *insert confused face expression*.

I am here on 13th, editing the second part, I did not fully fix it, I just fixed it for the situation with only one dot, otherwise they would paste "." ... "letter" if there were more into the set of unique solutions. I know how I would fix it, imagine binary, just with 26 different possibilities (0 - 25 aka. a - z) and for each extra dot we would just put out another 26 possibilities, starting at a, not a dot. Then just count up. (ex. aaa -> baa -> caa ... zzy -> zzz - while making sure none of them create the forbidden words). The problem is that I have spent too much time on this and even then the current function is always timing out because I run the check for forbidden word function (or how did I call it) each time I call the letter replacement instead of the dot. I would have to create another function that just checks in the vicinity of the dot, then also do that function and lastly also make sure it does not time out, which it already does even without the whole changing dots operation for the cases 11, 13, 14 and 15. I am not sure what is going on in the case 12. Either way, I have a math exam tomorrow and a lot of homework for management. It is already 8pm and I would be realistically chasing just 4 extra points, maybe 6 if the case 12 would magically fix itself and find the solutions, which is not worth failing Calc 2 imo. I absolutely hate to say it, but I have to give up here. It is like a little heartbreak, usually I fight until the last moment, but I just can't. I have done everything I could, gone to office hours, started extra early on the whole fucking thing, sacrificed more Economics study time (I have overall 27% grade there already), I just can't do this anymore and if I used AI for this, I would not feel like I deserve the grade anyway. I am trying to learn after all, which is more than just pass under any circumstances in my opinion. 

Lastly for number 3 I have implemented the other directions. It was much easier then I thought, I just had to add the -x directions into the directions set and let it fail if there was no space. I only had to add a test function that calculated whether the word would be out of bounds if it was that size and heureka! Now I believe I have done everything as all the easy test cases work (1-4). If not, I will update you but so far I am like 25 hours deep.
