Name: Ota Lichnovsky
Time spent: About 15 hours
Cooperation: Lance Schneider (kind of, will explain)

  I have started later then usual on the assignment because I was studying hard for the advanced microeconomics exam, but I still think I failed that exam (and most likely the class, it is the worst because now I feel like a waste, this is going to be my first ever failed class). I started on Thursday late and looked up how to even make the web crowler. The most challenging part about it was transferring the html into cpp (like lets say I wanted to get the body, I have to recognize how many links are there and then extract exactly 120 characters with spaces for the snippet which I got wrong). 

  At first I have tried doing it myself, but I just could not. It sucks that AI is now pretty much a requirement (I have been on the lecture where the teacher called out the students who beat him on the HW6, many of those as well when they showed the code had the chatGTP comments and outline...). I still do not understand for example line 14: std::regex exactly. I understand the iterating logic Deepseek went for (worked better for me than chatGTP, since I refuse to pay for premium, but everyone says it is worth it so I don't know). The most interesting thing is that I actually used to learn some really basic HTML in high school using Notepad++ but all the "translation" was done by AI, but it is wrong I suspect that it is due to not reading the body correctly, but the description somehow works. The mapping seems to be fine, but the score is where I got stuff wrong again, I guess I have done some operation incorrectly and the AI seems to be oblivious to that fact too, but well whatever. I got 8 total different versions of the program (3 started from scratch and 5 were more advanced).

  The logic is a mix between mine and AI's due to the translation reasons. I still do not know how to 100% make the crawler but understand it on the surface/slightly deeper level, just opening the link and finding is the part I don't understand, everything else is fine. I have learned something for this but this is just too time consuming. I did tell the AI to implement it's own comments so I can fully see how it goes through the structure earlier

  My friend Lance looked at this and tried to implement his own logic into the code and somehow got even less points than me before so... yea. There is the partial cooperation.

  In the end the days by hours are: T: 2 hours, F: 3 hours, S: 10 hours.

Also interestingly, Submitty does not immediately shit itself when you use "auto" on this assignment. In fact, you get the same result. Is that intended?
