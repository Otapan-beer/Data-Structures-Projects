Name: Ota Lichnovsky
Hours: about 10 hours
I have started on Wednesday with the code because I had a math exam, but I just lacked the sleep to fully commit to it and I also have an important exam on Monday that is the deciding factor whether I can pass in economics. 
So when i started n Tuesday, I have spent over 3 hours developing a baseline code.
On Thursday I had to prepare for Friday by doing all the other homework and also I was on like 4 hours of sleep again so I passed out after like 90 minutes of this.
Today I had spent the most time (about 6 hours, I have woken up kind of late), but the progress feels slim. 
I am sorry that the comments and the readme are "lacking" compared to my usual level, but I got into a problem where the bugs are looping themselves (patch A, B appears, patch B, C appears and with C appears A) and all get me the same 11 points. 
Thank you for the understanding that I have to sacrifice this homework, I just ran out of time and it is going nowhere. I am on the verge of giving up if ChatGTP won't come up with anything useful.

UPDATE
I am trying to debug with all the debug things added by AI and I just found out that am dumb as fuck, the damn parser was wrong and it was cutting one character of the name I do not even know how I got 11 points in the first place man, now I just have to solve the mess I created by fixing the wrong things (mostly the diamond problem again) and see of I can make it in a couple of minutes before the homework closes

I just need to solve the order now, I am so damn close it hurts...
