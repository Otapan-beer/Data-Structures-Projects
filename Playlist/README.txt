// Otakar Lichnovsky, started on 12th of January 2025

//Hours date (plus) - total:
// 1/12/2025 (+0.5) - 0.5
// 1/14/2025 (+2.5) - 3     ... I do count the time spent in office hours resolving the issues and (slowly) creating the code
// 1/15/2025 (+8.5) - 11.5  ... I added the hours the next day, I was too tired to do it yesterday immediately.
// 1/16/2025 (+7.0) - 18.5  ... I am counting 3AM as yesterday FYI

// Logs (in detail description of time spent, COPY OF README): 
// 1/12/2025 I started this programm on sunday, but nothing ran correctly. I will have to go to office hours again to fix it

// 1/14/2025 I had to do some homework on monday but a friend solved my issues, turns I was in the wrong directory and 
// I have spent like 2-3 hours looking up all the guides on google that I could lol. I am still learning from guides though.

// 1/15/2025 I am really sweating today, I have spend a couple more hours looking up tutorials on C++ to learn the syntax, but
// it didn't help much. I have woken up around 10 am and I am coding since about 11am. I went to the office hours yesterday
// and I got almost 25 lines of code with the first read function. I do not know how am I supposed to treat the "next"
// and "previous " actions in the output file. So far, I have spent over 4.5 hours writing 30 lines of code not accounting for
// the time spent on tutorials just today, over 6 with tutorials.

// 1/16/2025 Yesterday I returned from labs and worked on the code for about 4 more hours before going to sleep
// Also, I made about 50 lines of code in that time, big progress
// I am just finishing a final problem with the move function not working correctly by the index of 1 and I will be done.
// Today I have added in total extra 7 hours to finish the code off.
